      A couple years ago I changed careers to become a web developer and haven't looked back. 
      Since then, I've sharpened my skills through building and managing hundreds of websites 
      as the lead developer for a small business. I love working with React, Node, and Ruby on Rails. 
      If you happen to have a project that uses those technologies, I am probably interested in 
      working with you. Also, if you are interested in working with me, please send an email to 
      svwielga4 [at] gmail [dot] com.
      Thank You for visiting.
